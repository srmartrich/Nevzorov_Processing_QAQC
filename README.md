# Nevzorov_Processing_QAQC
This repository consists of Processing and QAQC codes for the Nevzorov Hot Wire Probe. The development of this code was for the Cold Air-Outbreak Experiment in the Sub-Arctic Region (CAESAR) field campaign funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). These codes, as they are now, is for both the National Center for Atmospheric Research Earth Observing Laboratory (NCAR-EOL), and, its main purpose, the University of Wyoming King Air (NSF-UWKA) facility. NCAR-EOL recently acquired a Nevzorov and likely will utilize the code within this repository, and the processing techniques illustrated in my Masters Thesis.
